#Fizz Buzz with tests
This version of the simple fizz buzz project is written as a method so that it returns the status of an entered number.

Multiples of 3 will return the String "Fizz", multiples of 5 "Buzz" and numbers which are multiples of both will return "FizzBuzz".

Numbers which are neither multiples of 3 or 5 will return an empty String.  

I have then added unit tests in two styles to expand my knowledge of JUnit 4.
